## To Run the Program:
Before executing any of these commands from the CMD or Terminal make sure you are in the correct directory path. If using Eclipse or a 
similar IDE, these procedures may not be required.
### To Run Part 1:
From terminal: java -classpath ./bin  p1MainClasses/Part1Main

From IDE: Run Part1Main.java from the p1MainClasses package
### To Run Part 2:
From terminal: java -classpath ./bin  p1MainClasses/Part2Main  n  m  isize  fsize  istep  rep

    Where:
    
       n = number of companies
       
       m = number of crimes
       
       isize = initial size for experimentations
       
       fsize = final size for experimentations
       
       isetp = incremental size step (how much the size increases by trial)
       
       rep = number of repetitions per size
       
     * For detailed information head to the in-code implementation *
From IDE: Run Part2Main.java, with the desired parameters, from the p1MainClasses package
## Part 1:
This part includes a working version of the four strategies to be implemented (P1, P2, P3, P4). 
Output produces the results for a particular input in which the intersection of all the sets is the set containing the corresponding
elements. (See results sample in "Part1 Sample Results Sheet.pdf")
## Part 2:
This part produces the empirical results for the execution times of each one of the four strategies in "part2Results/allResults.txt". (See running results sample graphs in "Part 2 Sample Results Sheets.pdf").
##Understanding the code:
In order tu understand the hierarchy of the classes, head to the "UML Kelvin Garcia CIIC4020-030.ucls" file or to the "README.pdf" file.
