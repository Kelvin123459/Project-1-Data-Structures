## To Run the Program:
Before executing any of these commands from the CMD or Terminal make sure you are in the correct directory path. If using Eclipse or a 
similar IDE, these procedures may not be required.
### To Run Part 1:
From terminal: java -classpath ./bin  p1MainClasses/Part1Main
### To Run Part 2:
From terminal: java -classpath ./bin  p1MainClasses/Part2Main  n  m  isize  fsize  istep  rep

    Where:
    
       n = number of companies
       
       m = number of crimes
       
       isize = initial size for experimentations
       
       fsize = final size for experimentations
       
       isetp = incremental size step (how much the size increases by trial)
       
       rep = number of repetitions per size

## Part 1:
This part includes a working version of the four strategies to be implemented (P1, P2, P3, P4)

Output produces
## Part 2:
This part produces the empirical results for the execution times of each one of the four strategies. (See running results sample graphs
in "Results Sheets".
